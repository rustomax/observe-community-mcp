# Observe Troubleshooting Runbook: Host Resource Exhaustion Analysis

Investigate CPU, memory, disk, and network resource exhaustion on hosts using Prometheus metrics and host logs. This runbook helps identify resource bottlenecks, capacity planning needs, and processes consuming excessive resources.

**Investigation Context:** Host resource exhaustion can cause widespread service degradation as multiple applications compete for limited resources. Common scenarios include memory leaks causing OOM conditions, CPU-intensive processes starving other applications, disk I/O bottlenecks from log growth or data processing, and network saturation from traffic spikes. Resource exhaustion may be gradual (memory leaks, log accumulation) or sudden (traffic spikes, batch jobs). The impact often extends beyond the immediately affected processes to cascade through dependent services. Understanding resource utilization patterns helps distinguish between capacity limits, inefficient resource usage, and abnormal consumption patterns requiring intervention.

**Key Investigation Areas:** Monitor CPU utilization patterns to identify sustained high usage vs. brief spikes, and distinguish between user processes and system overhead. Memory analysis should focus on available memory, swap usage, and process-level consumption to identify leaks or oversized processes. Disk metrics reveal I/O bottlenecks, storage capacity issues, and filesystem problems. Network utilization patterns help identify bandwidth exhaustion, packet loss, and connectivity issues. Compare current utilization against historical baselines and capacity limits. Look for resource consumption changes correlating with deployments, traffic increases, or batch processing schedules. Container and Kubernetes metrics provide additional context for resource allocation and limits.
