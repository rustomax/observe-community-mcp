A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing access to [Observe](https://observeinc.com) API functionality, OPAL query assistance, and troubleshooting runbooks through vector search.

## Purpose

This server is designed to work with technically capable LLM models, specifically tested with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Sonnet 4. Unlike traditional chatbots, this MCP server:

- Interfaces directly with the Observe platform in an LLM-friendly way
- Avoids using LLMs for internal functions to prevent private data leakage
- Serves as a secure bridge between third-party LLMs and your Observe data

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The newest addition to this MCP - the `execute_nlp_query` tool does leverage LLM under the hood (specifically Anthropic models). If this is not desirable, you can disable the tool. The caller LLM or agent can still use the MCP, but it will need to do more heavy lifting to get to the end result.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This is an experimental and unsupported MCP server created for testing and collaboration with Observe AI design partners. Observe or the author bear no liability for any use of this server and does not support it in any way. A separate production-ready closed-source MCP server is available to Observe customers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pinecone account with an API key
- Observe API credentials
- **For Natural Language Processing**: Anthropic API key (for `execute_nlp_query` tool)

### Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustomax/observe-experimental-mcp.git
cd observe-experimental-mcp
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in the values.

### Populating Vector Database

> **Note**: Pinecone's vector indices are *eventually consistent* - after populating an index, allow a few minutes for lookups to return the most recent data.

#### Documentation Index

The vector database needs to be populated with OPAL reference data before the server can provide semantic search capabilities. 

> **IMPORTANT**: if you are not an Observe employee, you won't have access to documentation markdown files. Please contact your Observe representative for assistance for this step.

Run the following command to populate the documentation database:

```bash
python populate_docs_index.py
```

> **Note**: If you have previously created the index and you want a clean slate, you can use the `--force` flag to recreate the index.

This will process all the markdown files in the `observe-docs` directory and create vector embeddings for semantic search. The script will:

- Read markdown files from the `observe-docs` directory (both documentation and prompts)
- Extract metadata and content from these files
- Generate embeddings for each document using Pinecone's integrated embedding model (llama-text-embed-v2)
- Store the embeddings and metadata in the Pinecone index

Options:
- `--force`: Force recreation of the index even if it already exists
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging
- `--limit <n>`: Limit the number of files to process (0 for no limit)

The script will show a progress bar as it processes the files and uploads them to Pinecone.

#### Runbooks Index

To populate the runbooks vector database, run:

```bash
python populate_runbooks_index.py
```

> **Note**: If you have previously created the index and you want a clean slate, you can use the `--force` flag to recreate the index.

This script will:

- Find all markdown (.md) files in the `runbooks` directory
- Chunk the content into semantically meaningful segments (approximately 1000 characters each)
- Generate embeddings for each chunk using Pinecone's integrated embedding model
- Store the embeddings and metadata in a separate Pinecone index for runbooks

Options:
- `--force`: Force recreation of the index even if it already exists
- `--runbooks_dir <path>`: Specify a custom path to the runbooks directory

The chunking process preserves the semantic meaning of the content while optimizing for vector search, but the `recommend_runbook` function will return complete runbooks, not just chunks.


Example run:

```bash
python ./populate_runbooks_index.py --force

```

## Running the Server

### Traditional Python Execution

```bash
python observe_server.py
```

The server runs with Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport by default on port 8000. You can modify the port and transport method in the `observe_server.py` file if needed.

### Docker Deployment

The server can be containerized using Docker for easier deployment and isolation.

#### Development with Docker

1. **Copy environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.docker .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys and configuration
   ```

2. **Start with docker-compose (development mode):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   
   This runs in development mode with source code mounted for live reloading.

3. **Access the server:**
   - MCP Server: `http://localhost:8000` (SSE transport)
   - Health monitoring: Automatic via Docker health checks

#### Production Deployment

For production deployments with nginx proxy and resource limits:

```bash
# Use production configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d

# Or with nginx proxy (for load balancing/SSL termination)
docker-compose --profile production up --build -d
```

#### Docker Configuration

- **Port**: 8000 (configurable via docker-compose)
- **Health Check**: Automatic health monitoring with restart policies
- **Security**: Non-root user execution, minimal attack surface
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable CPU/memory limits in production mode
- **Data Persistence**: Vector database and documentation mounted as volumes

#### Customizing Docker Deployment

- **Environment Variables**: Modify `.env` file or docker-compose environment section
- **Resource Limits**: Adjust in `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- **SSL/TLS**: Configure nginx section in docker-compose with your certificates
- **Custom Docs**: Mount your own `observe-docs` or `runbooks` directories

### Scope-Based Access Control

All tools are protected by scope-based authorization:
- **Admin scope** (`admin`): Full access to all tools including system information
- **Write scope** (`write`): Can create monitors and execute queries 
- **Read scope** (`read`): Can view datasets, monitors, and execute read-only operations

Scopes follow a hierarchical model where `admin` includes `write` and `read` permissions, and `write` includes `read` permissions.

### Worksheet Export Tool

The `export_worksheet` tool provides flexible worksheet data export functionality with multiple time parameter options:

#### Parameters

- **`worksheet_id`** (required): The ID of the worksheet to export
- **`time_range`** (optional): Time range for the export (e.g., "15m", "1h", "24h"). Defaults to "15m" if no time parameters are provided
- **`start_time`** (optional): Start time in ISO format (e.g., "2025-07-21T00:00:00Z")
- **`end_time`** (optional): End time in ISO format (e.g., "2025-07-22T00:00:00Z")

#### Time Parameter Combinations

The tool supports all standard Observe API time parameter patterns:

1. **Interval only** (relative to now): `export_worksheet("42566610", time_range="1h")`
2. **Start and end times**: `export_worksheet("42566610", start_time="2025-07-21T00:00:00Z", end_time="2025-07-22T00:00:00Z")`
3. **Start time + interval**: `export_worksheet("42566610", start_time="2025-07-21T00:00:00Z", time_range="24h")`
4. **End time + interval**: `export_worksheet("42566610", end_time="2025-07-22T00:00:00Z", time_range="24h")`

### Response Format

The tool returns data in NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) format. For large datasets, responses are automatically truncated with a summary showing the first 50 lines and total row count.

## Vector Database Helpers

The organized `src/pinecone/` package provides comprehensive Pinecone functionality:

**Core Modules:**
- `src/pinecone/client.py` - Initialize Pinecone client with support for multiple index types
- `src/pinecone/embeddings.py` - Generate embeddings for single texts and batches
- `src/pinecone/search.py` - Semantic search operations for both docs and runbooks  
- `src/pinecone/indexing.py` - Document and runbook indexing with portable path handling

**Key Functions:**

- `index_runbooks(runbooks_dir)` - Index runbooks with consistent chunking strategy

## Helper Classes and Utilities

The modular architecture includes several helper classes that improve developer experience and code maintainability:

### Observe API Helpers

**`QueryBuilder`** (`src/observe/queries.py`)
```python
# Build complex OPAL queries programmatically
builder = QueryBuilder()
query = builder.filter("service_name", "cartservice") \
              .filter("status_code", ">=", 400) \
              .timechart("5m", "count()") \
              .build()
```

**`WorksheetExporter`** (`src/observe/worksheets.py`)
```python
# Export worksheets with flexible time parameters
exporter = WorksheetExporter()
data = await exporter.export_with_time_range("42566610", "24h")
data = await exporter.export_with_time_window("42566610", start="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", end="2025-01-02T00:00:00Z")
```

### Authentication Helpers

**`PermissionChecker`** (`src/auth/permissions.py`)
```python
# Check user permissions programmatically
checker = PermissionChecker(user_scopes=["read", "write"])
if checker.can_create_monitors():
    # User can create monitors
if checker.can_access_admin_tools():
    # User has admin access
```

**`ScopeValidator`** (`src/auth/scopes.py`)
```python
# Validate scopes for complex scenarios
validator = ScopeValidator(required_scopes=["admin", "write"])
result = validator.validate(user_scopes)
if not result["has_access"]:
    return validator.get_access_error()
```

### Error Handling

The modules provide both dictionary-based and exception-based error handling patterns:

```python
# Dictionary-based errors (for MCP tools)
{"error": True, "message": "Access denied"}

# Exception-based errors (for internal logic)  
try:
    result = await some_operation()
except ObserveAPIError as e:
    return {"error": True, "message": str(e)}
```

## Architecture and How It Works

The system uses a multi-index vector database architecture to provide both documentation assistance and runbook recommendations. There are two main workflows: the indexing process and the runtime query process.

### Indexing Process

This diagram shows how documentation and runbooks are processed and loaded into the Pinecone vector database:

![Data Import](./images/mcp_vector.png)

### Runtime Query Process

This diagram shows how user queries are processed at runtime:

![Query Architecture](./images/mcp_query.png)

### Documentation Assistance Flow

1. The LLM assistant calls the MCP server with a user query for documentation
2. The `get_relevant_docs` function is called to process the query
3. The system generates an embedding for the query using Pinecone's inference API
4. This embedding is used to search the "observe-docs" index for relevant document chunks
5. The system groups chunks by source document and calculates relevance scores
6. Complete documents are retrieved from the filesystem and returned, ranked by relevance

### Runbook Recommendation Flow

1. The LLM assistant calls the MCP server with a user troubleshooting query
2. The `recommend_runbook` function is called to process the query
3. The system generates an embedding for the query using Pinecone's inference API
4. This embedding is used to search the "observe-runbooks" index for relevant runbook chunks
5. The system groups chunks by source runbook and calculates average relevance scores
6. The most relevant complete runbook is retrieved from the filesystem and returned to the user

## Advantages of the Vector Database Approach

- **Semantic Understanding**: Vector search understands the meaning of queries, not just keywords
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Can find relevant results even with typos or different wording
- **Relevance Ranking**: Results are ranked by semantic similarity
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new documents without schema changes
- **Direct Use of Markdown**: Uses markdown files as the source of truth
- **Integrated Embeddings**: Uses Pinecone's built-in embedding model, eliminating the need for OpenAI API keys
- **Scalability**: Pinecone provides a managed, scalable vector database service
- **Chunking with Full Document Retrieval**: Optimizes search accuracy through chunking while providing complete context through full document retrieval


## Setting up Authentication

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION. READ IT IN ITS ENTIRETY.**

There are two types of authentication mechanisms used in this server: Observe API authentication and MCP authentication.

**Observe API authentication (Observe API bearer token)** - this inherits the context of the token that is used to authenticate the user who created the token to the Observe platform. This token should be considered secret and is never exposed to the MCP users.

> **⚠️ DANGER ZONE**: The consequence of the above is that once a user is authenticated to the MCP server, they will **NOT** assume their identity in Observe, but the **identity of the user who generated the Observe token**. Make sure to use RBAC and limit access for the Observe API token to specific roles and permissions that you want to make available to the Observe MCP server users.

**MCP authentication (MCP bearer token)** - this is the authentication that is used to authorize the user to access and use the functionality of the MCP server. This token is generated by the server administrator and is exposed to the MCP users, for instance to use in Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.

This second layer of authentication is necessary because the server exposes resource-intensive APIs (like Pinecone) to MCP users. It allows server administrators to control access and prevent resource abuse. 

![Authentication](./images/mcp_auth.png)

**IMPORTANT**: Current implementation of the MCP server also includes a basic RBAC via predefined roles: `admin`, `read`, `write`. These **DO NOT** map into any roles in Observe. They are used to control access to the MCP server tools.

**Local-only deployment**: If you're running the server locally without public access, you can disable MCP authentication by modifying `observe_server.py` and removing the `Authorization` header from the MCP client configuration.

## Setting up MCP authentication

Create private and public key files in a secure location, i.e. in `_secure` directory.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```

This will create two files:
- `private_key.pem` - the private key file. Keep this secret - you will need it to sign the MCP bearer tokens.
- `public_key.pem` - the public key file. You will need to add this to the `observe_server.py` file.

```bash
cat public_key.pem
```

Copy the public key and add it to the `.env` file:

```bash
# Public PEM key for MCP token verification
PUBLIC_KEY_PEM="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
<your_public_key_here>
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
```

Sign the bearer token with the private key:

```bash
./generate_mcp_token.sh 'user@example.com' 'admin,read,write' '4H'
```

> **Security Best Practice**: Keep token expiration times short (hours rather than days). Avoid issuing long-lived tokens to minimize security risks.

## Using in Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` if you are running the MPC server locally, or provide the URL if you exposed the server publically. 

> **Network Configuration Note**: MCP clients typically restrict HTTP access to localhost only. For internet-accessible deployments, implement an HTTPS reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.) with proper DNS configuration and SSL certificates.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "observe-community": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "http://localhost:8000/sse",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer bearer_token"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The server runs on port 8000 by default. You can modify the port in the `observe_server.py` file if needed.

> **Performance Note**: The server uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport by default, streaming responses as they're generated for improved efficiency with large payloads. Transport method can be modified in `observe_server.py` if needed.

Example Startup:

```bash
mcp run ./observe_server.py

## Making the Most of the MCP Server

### Start with Natural Language Queries

The `execute_nlp_query` tool is designed to be your primary interface for data analysis. Simply describe what you want to investigate in natural language:

- **"Show me error rates by service in the last hour"**
- **"Find slow traces with high latency"**
- **"What services are having performance issues?"**
- **"Calculate 95th percentile response times by endpoint"**

The system automatically:
- Converts your request to proper OPAL syntax
- Validates field names against dataset schemas
- Handles error recovery if queries fail
- Returns formatted results with analysis

### Use a Smart Client LLM

This MCP server is designed to work with technically capable LLM models and has been specifically tested with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Sonnet 4. The combination of intelligent client LLMs and the server's NLP capabilities creates a powerful troubleshooting environment.

### Understand the Recommended Flow

The optimal workflow leverages both natural language processing and semantic search:

1. **Connect & Configure**: MCP client connects and adopts the system prompt to become an Observe expert
2. **Investigation Strategy**: Use `recommend_runbook()` to get structured troubleshooting approaches
3. **Data Discovery**: Use `list_datasets()` to find relevant data sources
4. **Natural Language Analysis**: Use `execute_nlp_query()` for most data analysis tasks
5. **Knowledge Augmentation**: Use `get_relevant_docs()` for OPAL syntax questions or advanced features
6. **Fallback to Manual**: Use `execute_opal_query()` only when you need precise control over query syntax

### Query Types and Tool Selection

**For Data Analysis** (90% of use cases):
- Use `execute_nlp_query()` - it handles OPAL generation, validation, and error recovery automatically

**For Platform Knowledge**:
- Use `get_relevant_docs()` for OPAL syntax questions and platform capabilities

**For Structured Investigation**:
- Use `recommend_runbook()` to get methodology, then `execute_nlp_query()` for data analysis

**For Manual Control**:
- Use `execute_opal_query()` only when you need to validate specific OPAL syntax or have precise requirements

### Hard-Code the System Prompt

As mentioned earlier, when the MCP client first connects to the MCP server it will discover available tools and their descriptions and the MCP server will try to convince the model to use system prompt in `prompts/Observe MCP System Prompt.md` to configure itself as an Observe expert. In situations where the model fails to do so, it might need more calls to accomplish the requested tasks. To ensure the most consistent use of the MCP server, hardcode the system prompt into your LLM configuration, do not rely on the MCP server to configure the model. Here is an example of how to do it in Claude Desktop:

![Claude Desktop System Prompt](./images/claude_system_prompt.png)

### Craft Effective Prompts

Prompt engineering still applies! You can speed up the investigations by crafting effective prompts, by including clear objectives for the investigation, specifying time ranges of interest to focus the analysis, identifying relevant datasets or systems that should be examined and defining the expected output format, such as requesting a summary with the top 3 issues.

You can also use progressive disclosure to help the LLM build a mental model of your environment. Start with high-level questions and progressively dive deeper based on findings. As you progress through investigation, provide feedback. When the LLM makes incorrect assumptions or uses tools ineffectively, nudge it in the right direction to guide it back on track.

### Use Runbooks to Guide LLMs

Feel free to create, update or delete runbooks as you see fit. Tweak them to your particular environment or use-cases. For instance, if you created a number of custom datasets that are unique to your environment, create a custom runbook that helps LLM use them in investigations. Use LLMs to improve your runbooks by using `Improve this prompt` type of prompt.

### Remind LLMs to Use Tools

Due to sheer volume of tokens pushed into LLM's context window for the investigative process, the LLM can become "forgetful" and stop using available tools effectively. For instance, it might repeatedly struggle to craft a working OPAL query. You can nudge it in the right direction by reminding it to use `get_dataset_info` tool, which returns a list of fields and their types, as well as `get_relevant_docs` tool, which performs semantic search across the documentation and returns relevant chunks. Using these tools in combination dramatically improves the LLM's ability to craft working OPAL queries.

## Maintenance

### Updating Documentation

To update the vector database with new documentation:
1. Add or update markdown files in the `observe-docs` directory
2. Run `python populate_docs_index.py --force` to rebuild the index

### Updating Runbooks

To update the runbooks vector database:
1. Add or update markdown files in the `runbooks` directory
2. Run `python populate_runbooks_index.py --force` to rebuild the index

Both populate scripts now use the organized `src/pinecone/` modules for consistent functionality and maintenance.

## Addendum: NLP Agent Architecture

This section is light bed-time reading, because the rest of the document wasn't dense enough. You are welcome.

### Critical Usage Requirements

The `execute_nlp_query` tool requires **two essential parameters**:
1. **`dataset_id`** (string): The specific Observe dataset to query against
2. **`request`** (string): Natural language description of the desired analysis

**Important**: The caller must identify the appropriate dataset BEFORE using this tool. Use `list_datasets` to explore available datasets or `get_dataset_info` to understand dataset schemas and contents. The NLP agent cannot determine which dataset to use from the natural language request alone.

**Typical Workflow**:
1. `list_datasets` → Identify relevant datasets  
2. `get_dataset_info("dataset_id")` → Understand schema and data structure
3. `execute_nlp_query("dataset_id", "natural language request")` → Execute analysis

### Technical Architecture

The `execute_nlp_query` tool implements a multi-component agent system for converting natural language requests into OPAL queries. Rather than simple pattern matching, the system uses several specialized components to handle schema validation, error recovery, and query optimization.

```

### Component Architecture

The NLP agent operates through several specialized components, each handling different aspects of query processing:

#### 1. Schema Analysis Agent
**Purpose**: Understanding available data structures
- Retrieves real dataset schemas from Observe
- Identifies available fields, types, and relationships
- Validates field names against actual dataset structure
- Prevents "field not found" errors before query execution

#### 2. Documentation Retrieval Agent  
**Purpose**: Knowledge-augmented query generation
- Performs semantic search across OPAL documentation
- Retrieves relevant syntax patterns and examples
- Ensures generated queries follow best practices
- Provides context for complex analytical patterns

#### 3. Query Generation Agent
**Purpose**: Natural language to OPAL translation
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4 for sophisticated language understanding
- Converts analytical intent into syntactically correct OPAL
- Applies schema knowledge to use correct field names
- Incorporates documentation patterns for optimal query structure

#### 4. Validation Agent
**Purpose**: Pre-execution quality assurance
- Validates OPAL syntax before execution
- Checks for common anti-patterns (SQL syntax, time filtering, etc.)
- Applies automatic corrections for known issues
- Prevents execution of malformed queries

#### 5. Execution Agent
**Purpose**: Reliable query execution with resilience
- Executes queries against Observe APIs
- Implements exponential backoff for transient failures
- Monitors execution performance and resource usage
- Provides detailed execution context for debugging

#### 6. Error Recovery System
**Purpose**: Automated failure handling and correction

    style K fill:#e8f5e8
    style J fill:#fff3e0
```

### Recovery Strategy Matrix

The system implements a five-tier recovery approach:

| Attempt | Strategy | Focus | Success Rate |
|---------|----------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | **Direct Execution** | Generated query as-is | ~70% |
| 2 | **Syntax Correction** | Fix obvious OPAL syntax issues | ~85% |
| 3 | **Schema-Guided Recovery** | Use dataset schema to fix field references | ~90% |
| 4 | **Documentation-Augmented** | Retrieve specific OPAL patterns for error type | ~95% |
| 5 | **Simplification Fallback** | Generate simpler, safer query | ~98% |

### Error Classification

The system categorizes errors to select appropriate recovery strategies:

```mermaid

    style I fill:#e8f5e8
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
    style K fill:#e8f5e8
    style L fill:#e8f5e8
```

### Learning and Adaptation

The system incorporates several learning mechanisms:

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies common error patterns across queries
- Builds library of successful correction strategies
- Adapts validation rules based on frequent failures

#### Context Preservation
- Maintains context across recovery attempts
- Uses previous attempt failures to inform next strategy
- Preserves user intent while adapting implementation

#### Performance Optimization
- Tracks query performance and optimization opportunities
- Suggests more efficient query patterns when possible
- Balances accuracy with execution speed

### Key Agent Capabilities

#### Semantic Understanding
- Parses analytical intent beyond keyword matching
- Recognizes patterns: "error rates", "slow queries", "performance issues"
- Maps business concepts to technical implementation

#### Contextual Adaptation
- Adapts query complexity based on dataset characteristics
- Adjusts aggregation strategies based on data types
- Optimizes performance based on dataset size

#### Self-Healing Operation
- Automatically corrects common syntax errors
- Recovers from schema mismatches
- Handles API-level failures gracefully

This multi-component architecture achieves the 90%+ success rate through layered validation, error recovery, and continuous learning from query execution patterns.

### Real-World Agent Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Error Rate Analysis

User Request: "Show me error rates by service in the last hour"

```
Agent Process:
1. Schema Agent: Identifies fields like 'error', 'service_name' in dataset
2. Documentation Agent: Retrieves error rate calculation patterns
3. Query Generator: Creates OPAL query with conditional aggregation
4. Generated Query: statsby error_rate:avg(if(error, 1.0, 0.0)), total_requests:count(), group_by(service_name)
5. Result: ✅ Success on first attempt
```

#### Example 2: Complex Recovery Scenario

User Request: "Find slow database queries over 2 seconds"

```
Attempt 1: Filter duration > 2s (FAILS - field not found)
├── Error Classification: Field reference error
├── Schema Consultation: Finds 'response_time' field instead
└── Recovery Query: filter response_time > 2000

Attempt 2: Filter response_time > 2000 (FAILS - wrong units)  
├── Error Classification: Logic error (no results)
├── Documentation Search: Finds duration patterns in nanoseconds
└── Recovery Query: filter response_time > 2000000000

Attempt 3: ✅ Success - Returns slow query analysis
```

#### Example 3: Multi-Tier Validation and Correction

User Request: "Show me case when error count by hour"

```
Initial Generation: 

SELECT CASE WHEN error_count > 0 THEN 'has_errors' ELSE 'no_errors' END, 
       COUNT(*) 
FROM dataset 
WHERE timestamp > timestamp - 1h 
GROUP BY hour
```

Validation Agent Detects:
- ❌ SQL syntax (not OPAL)
- ❌ Time filtering in query  
- ❌ case() function (should be if())

Auto-Corrections Applied:
- Convert SQL to OPAL syntax
- Remove time filtering (handled by API)
- Replace case() with if() function

Final Query:
```opal
statsby error_status:if(error_count > 0, "has_errors", "no_errors"), 
        total_count:count(), 
        group_by(error_status) | 
timechart 1h, count()

Result: ✅ Success after automatic correction
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Overall Success Rate** | 90%+ | Queries that execute successfully and return meaningful results |
| **First-Attempt Success** | ~70% | Queries that succeed without any recovery needed |
| **Average Recovery Time** | <2 seconds | Time from failure detection to successful re-execution |
| **Schema Validation Accuracy** | 98%+ | Correct field name usage after schema consultation |
| **Syntax Correction Rate** | 95%+ | Automatic fixes that result in valid OPAL |
| **Mean Response Time** | 1.2 seconds | Average time from request to formatted result |

The agent system makes observability data accessible through natural language while maintaining the precision of expert-written queries.
